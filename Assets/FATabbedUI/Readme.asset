    - Please use nested canvases. You will notice in our MainMenuDemo that each page
      is its own canvas. This will highly increase performance.

    lines:
    - To simply use a scrollable UI, you can just add the FAScrollSnapBehaviour script
      on your scroll view, and play with the settings to achieve your desired speed
      or size.
  - heading: Tab Bar (Bottom Toolbar)
    linkText: 
    url: 
    lines:
    - To include the bottom toolbar drag and drop the Bottom Toolbar prefab into
      your canvas. The only required thing is to drag the FAScrollSnapBehaviour object
      into the Scroll Snap Rect property of the FATabBar script.
    - The tab bar can have any number of child buttons, but for obvious reason that
      number should be the same of the number of pages in the scroll view.
  - heading: Nested Scrolls
    linkText: 
    url: 
    lines:
    - This asset includes functionality for nested scroll views.
    - When you are setting up your nested scrolls, replace unity's built-in ScrollRect
      component with our FaScrollRect and remember to drag your inner scrolls into
      the FAScrollSnapBehaviour properties.
  - heading: Flexible Design
    linkText: 
    url: 
    lines:
    - The FAScrollSnapBehaviour script is super flexible and can be used in other
      systems like Level Selection for example.
    - Please check out our Demo Scenes to see the script in action.
